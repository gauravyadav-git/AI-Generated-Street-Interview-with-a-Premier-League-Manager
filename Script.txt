Interviewer: “Mikel, reflecting on Arsenal’s performance this past season, what stood out to you the most?”

Mikel Arteta: “It was a season of growth and resilience. At home, we averaged around one and a half goals per match, which showed how strong we were at the Emirates. But we also dropped points away from home, and that’s an area we know we need to improve.”

Interviewer: “Possession seemed to play a big role in Arsenal’s style. How do you see that connecting with your results?”

Mikel Arteta: “Yes, when we controlled possession, particularly at home, we created more chances and usually converted that into goals. It wasn’t perfect, but there’s a clear link between dominating the ball and dictating games.”

Interviewer: "Despite the strong home form, there were a few surprising losses on the road. What do you attribute those to, and how will you address them?"

Mikel Arteta: "Those away losses were definitely a tough pill to swallow. Sometimes it was about not taking our chances, other times it was lapses in concentration. We've analyzed them thoroughly, and a key focus will be developing a more robust mentality and tactical flexibility when playing away from the Emirates."

Interviewer: "The team showed incredible spirit at various points in the season, often coming back from difficult situations. How important is that mental fortitude for your long-term vision?"

Mikel Arteta: "Mental fortitude is absolutely critical. It's the foundation of any successful team. Building that resilience and never-say-die attitude is something we've worked hard on, and it's essential for competing for titles. We want a team that always fights to the very end."

Interviewer: “And looking ahead, what can fans expect from Arsenal next season?”

Mikel Arteta: “The supporters can expect even more consistency. We’ll work hard on improving our away form, being tighter defensively, and making sure possession leads to goals. The goal is to keep building a team that can compete at the very top.”
